# Infinity × Fugue — Unified Code Analysis Engine

> *"A language that an AI can use to talk about math while it's doing math."*

A Python code analysis engine built entirely on a single meta-mathematical framework — **Mathematical Contrapuntalism**. Not a linter with math added on top. The math *is* the analysis.

## What It Does

Analyzes Python code in two dimensions simultaneously: 🐍⛎

**Security Dissonance** — finds vulnerabilities by proving that Γ cannot establish "input at sink S is safe":
- SQL Injection
- Command Injection
- Path Traversal (read, write, and `with open(...)` forms)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Unsafe Deserialization
- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- Missing Authorization
- Code Injection (eval/exec)
  "core OWASP web vulnerabilities."

**Structural Dissonance** — finds code quality issues by proving logical contradictions:
- Unreachable code (after return, raise, constant-false conditions)
- Unused variables (scope-aware, closure-aware)
- Wasted assignments (overwritten before first read)
  
  This is essentially what tools like:
- Pylint
- SonarQube
do for quality checks.

**Mathematical Analysis** — every run produces:
- G(x) = Σ aₙxⁿ — depth-indexed generating function (structural fingerprint)
- K(x) normalized — Kolmogorov complexity via compression
- Halstead metrics — Volume, Difficulty, Effort, Estimated Bugs
- Banach convergence — Jaccard distance tracking across runs
- Structural transposition — isomorphism detection between programs

## The Framework 🪟

Each analysis stage maps exactly to one of the five original reasoning moves:

| Move          | Math.                          | Engine Stage                                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Subject.      | G(x) = Σ aₙxⁿ                  | SubjectExtractor — reads structural shape, not values |
| Dissonance.   | Γ ⊢ φ ⟺ ¬(Γ ∪ {¬φ} consistent)| DissonanceDetector + PathSensitiveTaintAnalyzer       |
| Transposition | F : C ≅ D                     | TranspositionFinder — structural DNA matching         |
| Resolution.   | lim \|Sₙ − L\| < ε.            | ResolutionPredictor — Banach fixed-point convergence. |
| Compression   | K(x) = min{\|p\| : U(p) = x}   | KolmogorovComplexity + HalsteadMetrics                |

Security analysis is not a sixth thing. It is **Dissonance at full depth** — the same formal structure, applied to a harder class of logical contradiction: the security contract a program makes with its users.

### Key Design Decisions 🔑🐾

**File combination** — multi-file and ZIP analysis combines all `.py` files with `# === FILE: path ===` headers. Offsets tracked so every finding reports `local_lineno` (line within its own file). Offset math uses `current_line += line_count + 1` — verified zero-discrepancy across all 89 files in the microdot test zip.

**Singleton engine** — instantiated once at server start so Banach convergence history accumulates across the server lifetime.

**Path-sensitive taint** — CFG × TaintState product construction:
- `abort()` and `raise` are path terminators — correctly propagates authorization guards
- `BinOp` returns taint from either operand — fixes the most common injection blind spot
- `with open(f) as h:` — taint propagates into the `as` variable and body
- All function bodies analyzed unconditionally — Flask `@app.route` functions included

&nbsp;

**Key for pattern-based vs taint-based security (⚠️ vs ✅):**

Pattern-based scanners flag calls to known dangerous functions (`os.system`, `pickle.loads`, `eval`) regardless of whether the input is actually user-controlled. This produces false positives when the argument is a constant string, and false negatives when the dangerous call is indirect.

Taint-based analysis (what Infinity × Fugue uses) tracks data flow from user-controlled sources (`request.args`, `request.form`, `request.data`, etc.) through the call graph to a sink. It only fires when a real path exists from source to sink — meaning it catches injections the pattern scanners miss, and stays quiet on safe code that pattern scanners would flag.

&nbsp;

**What each tool is actually for:**

- **Flake8** — PEP 8 style enforcement. Fast, no false positives, integrates everywhere. Use it.
- **Pylint** — Comprehensive code quality. Catches logic errors, import issues, naming conventions. Slow but thorough.
- **Bandit** — Quick security scan, good for CI gates. Pattern-based so review every finding manually.
- **Mypy** — Type correctness. If your codebase uses type hints, mypy is essential.
- **Semgrep** — Security rules at scale. Best when you need custom rules for your own patterns.
- **SonarQube** — Enterprise analysis platform. Best for teams with CI/CD pipelines and long-term trend dashboards.
- **Infinity × Fugue** — Mathematical code intelligence. Path-sensitive taint analysis, structural fingerprinting, and convergence tracking. Best when you want to understand *why* code is vulnerable, not just *that* it is.

These tools are not mutually exclusive. Flake8 + Bandit + Infinity × Fugue together cover style, quick security gates, and deep taint analysis with zero overlap.
